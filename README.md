# Angular Introduction course

This project is a result of an introduction course held for my fellow teammates.
It has been structured in multiple sessions, one hour each.

The course covered:
- Angular architecture
- Main building blocks explained (NgModule, Component, Service, Pipe, Directive, Router)
- Data bindings examples (can be found in [```app/components```](https://github.com/ionutVizitiu/angular-introduction/tree/master/src/app/components))
- Lazy loading modules ([```app-routing.module.ts```](https://github.com/ionutVizitiu/angular-introduction/blob/master/src/app/app-routing.module.ts))
- Typescript
- Interfaces
- Observables
- Angular Material
- How to use third party libraries

The project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
